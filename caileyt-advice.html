        <h1>Hi, my name is Cailey. I'm a student just like you and I have some advice for you!</h1>

            <h4>You're going to be out of your comfort zone</h4>

            <p>I'm going to say something that's pretty obvious, being out of your comfort zone probably feels
                uncomfortable. Those doubts and fears may have crept in. You may feel lost, stuck, and don't understand
                what you're doing or why. But hey, you're learning something completely new. Those feelings are
                completely normal. It takes time for all these brand new things we are learning to sink in. Which brings
                me to my next pointâ€¦</p>

            <h4>Be Gentle with Yourself</h4>

            <p>You may be feeling frustrated with yourself that things are clicking right away. But remember how far
                you've come from the decision to sign up for the program up until now! You're learning A LOT! It's not
                just learning how to read, or even just write in a new language. You're also learning how to solve
                problems all in a language that is brand new to you! So be kind to yourself. You need to give yourself a
                break! Figuratively andâ€¦</p>

            <h4>LITERALLY. Give Yourself A Break.</h4>

            <p>Yes, I get it. You want to learn these things as fast as possible so that you can get out there in the
                world of tech! You want to power through the lessons and projects so you can go out there and get your
                dream job! It seems to be going well and then all of a suddenâ€¦ You've hit a wall. You're stuck and you
                can't find the issue. Don't panic. It's solvable. Give yourself a break. Step away from the computer. Go
                get some fresh air. Do some yoga. Put on your favorite song and have a dance party. (Grey's Anatomy
                anyoneâ€¦?). Drink some water. Get some sleep. Try tackling that issue now. You may find that tackling
                that issue may be a bit easier with fresh eyes.</p>

            <h4>Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help</h4>

            <p>You've tried to literally give yourself a break and still can't solve the issueâ€¦ That's absolutely okay.
                Normal even. Don't be afraid to ask for help!</p>
            <p>There is a whole community on the SkillCrush slack that is cheering you on! Don't slack on the
                opportunity to join this wonderful community. Terrible puns asideâ€¦</p>
            <p>There are instructors and fellow students that are willing to help you figure out why things aren't
                looking quite right. There are people that have been in your shoes, made the same mistakes, and they can
                help.</p>

            <h4>Practice, Practice, and guess what? MORE PRACTICE.</h4>

            <p>You're learning new languages. Of course there is going to be some confusion along the way. But you know
                what helps? (HINT: It's in the titleâ€¦) Practice. Repetition is your friend. Review those notes and study
                guides. Do all the projects. That's why it is all there for us! Experiment with things so you can see
                what works and what doesn't. And don't be afraid to make mistakes along the way! That's how you get
                better!</p>
            <p>(BONUS: Take this project for example. You could just speed through it. But why don't you make it you're own!
                Play around with all the skills you've learned in previous lessons. Take this opportunity to practice
                those skills without being told exactly what to do. Have fun and experiment! Make those mistakes and make your skills better ðŸ˜‰)</p>

            <h4>Above All Elseâ€¦ Don't Quit.</h4>
            <p>Remind yourself:
            <ul>
                <li>You can do this!</li>
                <li>What motivated you to be here in the first place</li>
                <li>How a career in tech can change your life</li>
                <li>How far you've come to get to this point!</li>
            </ul>
            So repeat after me. Keep going. YOU CAN DO THIS! You're going to do great things. I believe in you ðŸ™‚
